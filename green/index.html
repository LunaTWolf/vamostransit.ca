            <h3>About VAMOS Transit: Going Green</h3>
            <p>At VAMOS Transit, we understand the importance of reducing our environmental impact while providing reliable public transportation. That's why we've committed to adopting green technologies to help reduce emissions, minimize our carbon footprint, and contribute to a cleaner, more sustainable future for our communities.</p>

            <h3>Green Initiatives</h3>
            <p>We are proud to announce our transition to hybrid and electric buses. By incorporating these advanced technologies into our fleet, we're taking significant steps to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and help combat climate change. Our hybrid buses combine fuel-efficient internal combustion engines with electric motors, resulting in reduced fuel consumption and lower emissions. In addition, our fully electric buses operate without the need for fossil fuels, offering zero emissions and quieter, more efficient rides for passengers.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Hybrid Buses</strong>: These buses combine the power of traditional fuel engines with electric motors, offering a greener alternative that reduces overall fuel consumption and emissions.</li>
                <li><strong>Electric Buses</strong>: Our new electric buses are completely emissions-free and provide a quiet, smooth ride. They contribute to reducing air pollution and promote healthier, cleaner urban environments.</li>
                <li><strong>Energy Efficiency</strong>: We’ve implemented energy-saving technologies, such as regenerative braking, to further reduce energy consumption and make our fleet more efficient.</li>
                <li><strong>Eco-Friendly Infrastructure</strong>: We're also upgrading our charging stations and facilities to support our electric buses, ensuring they stay powered and ready for daily service.</li>
            </ul>
